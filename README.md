The **CloudFamily** is a new initiative to try and bring the community together and share content. 

We would like to **promote people**, the work they do and to have a place to come and find useful information like blogs and projects which people take time to create.

We are looking to try to get people started on their journey of creating content as well as bring the community together so that we can meet new friends and learn from other people's content.

**Everyone** is welcome, please fork the repo and add yourself in, or ping Gregor Suttie Or Richard Hooper on twitter and we'll help you get started and added in.
